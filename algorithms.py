    """
    Compute a path from a start point to a goal region, avoiding obstacles, using the FMT* algorithm.

    Parameters:
    - start (tuple): A tuple (x, y) representing the starting point of the path.
    - goal (list): A list of tuples [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...], representing vertices of the polygon defining the goal region.
    - obstacles (list): A list of obstacles, each represented by a tuple (x, y, width, height).
    - Nmax (int): The maximum number of random samples to generate in the configuration space.
    - eta (float): A scaling factor used to determine the connection radius in the FMT* algorithm.

    Returns:
    - path (list): A list of tuples [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...], representing the found path from start to goal.
    - V (list): A list of Node objects, representing all sampled nodes in the configuration space.

    Notes:
    - The function assumes a 2D configuration space and works with Euclidean distances.
    - The goal is defined as a polygon and the path is considered found when any node within this polygon is reached.
    - Obstacles are assumed to be axis-aligned rectangles.
    - The function utilizes several helper functions (e.g., `is_point_inside_obstacle`, `nearest_neighbors`, etc.) which need to be defined elsewhere in the code.
    - The function may print progress information (iterations, nodes in tree, unvisited nodes) to the console during execution.
